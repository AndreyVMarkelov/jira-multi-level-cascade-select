 Welcome to Jira Multi level cascade select plug in !!!

 Multi Level Cascade Select Plug in is a Plug In for the Atlassian Jira issue Tracker,
 that models a new custom field.
 The new custom field allows you to have a cascading select with a multi level selection.

 If you are upgrading from versions < 2.4, you need to rebuild the JIRA index

== Sys admins ==

  You maybe received the `${project.artifactId}-${project.version}-${config}.zip` package,
  please copy all the files under `WEB-INF` directory to `${ATLASSIAN_HOME}/WEB_INF/`.
  Simply extract the plug-in in the Jira Directory and the new Multi Level Cascading Select Custom Field will be added.
